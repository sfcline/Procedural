# Production Line Tracker

This is an application is for a media player production facility that will keep track of what products are produced. <br />
I made this project as an assignment for my Procedural Programming class at FGCU as a beginner to C++.<br />
This was a semester long project that was made using a top-down approach to programming.<br />

# Features
* Allow a user to add new products that are able to be produced and store them in a collection.
* The collection of products that can be produced can be displayed at any time.
* Allow a user to track production of products, including specifying how many items of that product were created.
* The collection of created items can be displayed at any time.
* Production statistics can be displayed â€“ Total items produced, number of each item type, the number of unique products created etc.
* Employee accounts can be made.

## Documentation

Create a docs folder in your project. If using Java, generate JavaDoc in your IDE. If using C++, use Doxygen. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc/doxygen index.html file with this markdown: \[Text to appear]\(URL) <br />
The URL will be YourGitHubUserName.github.io/YourRepositoryName/foldername/filename<br /> 
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL. <br />
Sample: \[JavaDoc]\(https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html) <br /> <br />
[JavaDoc](https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html)
